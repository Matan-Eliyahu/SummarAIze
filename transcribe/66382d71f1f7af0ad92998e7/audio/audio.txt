Sitting for your Bagrut examination in English. In a moment you will hear the text of your listening comprehension test which will be read twice. And now the first broadcast. Vetah Hashmaarishona. Hello listeners, my name is John Leavitt. Welcome to our program interesting jobs. Today we are talking to Susan Berger. Susan writes stories that people can listen to when they go to bed. Hello, Susan. Hello, John. Why do you write these stories, Susan? To help people fall asleep. As you know, parents all over the world read stories to their children at night to help them relax and fall asleep. But what about the parents? Many adults cannot fall asleep when they go to bed. My job is to help them. How do you help them? Well, research shows that if you hear a relaxing story when you go to bed, it will help you fall asleep. The stories I write are very relaxing. They are only 15 minutes long and they are not exciting because I want to help listeners relax. What are the stories about? Most of the stories are about a hero who goes on a trip to a beautiful, quiet place. And who reads your stories for the listeners? People who work as storytellers. They read the stories in soft, relaxing voices. Are there any sounds in your stories? Oh yes. There are always nice sounds, like birds singing or the sound of the rain. I dont use the same sounds in every story, because different people like different sounds. So what happens at the end of the story? The hero arrives at the beautiful, quiet place and falls asleep. But I dont want the listeners to get to the end of the story. Really? Why don't you want them to hear the end? Because I want them to fall asleep before the end of the story. I see. Well, I have trouble falling asleep too, so I'll try to listen to one of your stories. Thank you for talking to us today and goodbye. Zoita Rishona nashmia lim Wachakachev.
